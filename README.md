# tilejar
#### a Node.js and Mapnik based Tileserver

This is a draft of a more robust tile server that takes advantage of styles and sources generated in mapbox studio.
To run the sample, run the following code.
```
  git clone https://github.com/jaredbrookswhite/tilejar.git
  cd tilejar
  npm install
  node index.js
```
navigate to http://localhost:8000/?map=sample
